## Overview of the game and the inspirations used

Inter slasher is a top down 2D Unity game inspired by *Neon White*. The game emphasizes fast, stylish gameplay with a focus on tight controls, flashy visuals, and a strong sense of flow. The game follows the theme of "risk it for a biscuit" as you have to take a chance with the weapons youre using to have the best chance of surviving to the other levels to get a high score.It is a fast paced game in order to make the players think on their feet about the best actions to take. 

## Installation and setup instructions
- **Installation**  
The game can be downloaded from the link given on the itch page

## Objection of the game 

The objection of the game is to survive against the enemies to make it to the next level. Players will have different abilities for their weapons which are disposable so it causes them to think which ones to use that will give them the most benefits. When each level is completed its added to a score and the player must try to get the highest score possible to win. 

## Core Gameplay mechanics
- **Twin-stick shooter foundation**  
  The player moves with WASD and aims/shoots with the mouse. Movement should feel responsive, with acceleration and deceleration to provide weight.
  
- **Movement-based abilities**  
  This game aims to incorporate high-mobility mechanics such as dashes, wall jumps, or teleportation. Abilities should enhance both combat and movement flow.

- **Ability cycling system**  
  Similar to *Neon White*, abilities can be used in two ways:
  - Normal use (e.g., shooting, throwing, or skill activation).
  - Discard use (e.g., dash, area attack, or teleport).  
  Abilities could be distributed randomly or earned through pickups, adding a roguelite element.

- **Fast-paced arena structure**  
  Levels are designed for short, high-intensity sessions. Players clear waves of enemies in an arena, and upon completion, an exit opens to the next stage. A timer and scoring system in place encourages replayability and speedrunning.

## Visual and Stylistic elements
- Pixel art graphics with high-contrast, vibrant palettes.
- Visual effects for player actions:
  - Screen shake on impactful events.
  - Afterimages for dashes or fast movement.
  - Flash and glow effects on abilities.
- Enemy attack patterns resembling bullet-hell mechanics.

Since the gam jam has different sections for ratings on the games, we wanted to make sure our visuals were strong and stood out. We found the idea of using old technology screens as our themes for each level really interesting so that influenced the assets made. This also gives the game a nostalgic feel.
